# FAQ
**How to I compile this into an .iwd?** Put all the folders here in a folder, then compress it into a .rar/.zip then rename the extension to .iwd.</br>
**Where do I put the .iwd?** Place it in your IW4x directory => userraw</br>
**How do I change the music?** By going into the .iwd => sound => music => and replace the hz_t_oilrig_themestealth_v1.mp3 file.</br>
**Why isn't there any player card on the menu?** This is because it's a new feature in v1.1. If you downloaded another version from bypasses IW4x launcher or elsewhere, it could be an older version with less features.</br>
